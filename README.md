## Back end for CryptoPunks vanilla JS application

## Front end can be found at [https://github.com/danainjax/punks-front-end](https://github.com/danainjax/punks-front-end)

'punks' is a Rails application on the back end with a vanilla javascript front end.   

A punk is a visual representation of the popular CryptoPunks, the World's first NFT's, non-fungible tokens, first on the blockchain art on Ethereum. This project combines rendering the images of those NFTs and their attributes, the ability to search for a punk by its number (there are over 10,000), a way to 'comment' and 'like' a punk, and for further development a way to implement a contract.  

 This project combines features of social media, and was a useful tool in learning JavaScript. The business problem it solves was learning the language through hands-on building.   

Built with:  

JavaScript, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and a lot of early mornings.
